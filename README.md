The code first loads a sentiment analysis dataset and visualizes the distribution of sentiments using a bar plot. It then generates a word cloud based on the 'Summary' column of the data. After cleaning the data by removing missing values, it splits the dataset into training and test sets. The CountVectorizer is used to convert the text data into a bag-of-words format. The Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers are trained on the training data, and their performances are evaluated using accuracy scores and classification reports.

Two functions, sentiment_mt and sentiment_rf, are defined to predict the sentiment of a given text input using the trained models (Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest, respectively). These functions take the input text, transform it into the appropriate format using the vectorizer, and then predict and return the sentiment.
